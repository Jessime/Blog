    "# How to Make Your First Blog Post with Nikola\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided I wanted to revamp my blog. I was previously running with [blogger](https://www.blogger.com/), but as my posts became more technical, it basically devolved to linking to a Github Gist holding a jupyter notebook. So my biggest requirement was that my new site generator had to have great support for notebooks. My next biggest requirement was that I wanted to be able to have comments on the blog, which should hopefully foster discussion. Finally, I wanted something that won't get in my way as I'm writing. Content is significantly more important than spending time tinkering with blog settings. It seems like [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/) fits the bill pretty well. Since this is my first go around, I'll begin by following their '[Getting Started](https://getnikola.com/getting-started.html)' guide.\n",
